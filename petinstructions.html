<h1 style="color:White;">All you need to know about Mario!</h1>


<h2 style="color:Red;">Know Mario!</h2>
<p style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;"><b>Hello! For those of you who are students at Drexel, I hope most of you'd be knowing me by now. If not, you deserve to be kicked out of the University! But, for those who don't know me, I am Mario the Magnificent! Officially, I've been living at Drexel (33rd and Market) from 80 years now. A special thing about me is that I love to meet new people. And this webpage is a chance to know more about me! But, read the instructions before you fiddle with me! I am FUN, but at the same time I am DANGEROUS! </b></p>

<h2 style="color:Red;">Know My Moods!</h2>
<p style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;"><b>Okay Folks! Before we move further, let's recall one GOLDEN rule of the life : "TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED!" Don't ignore this, because you'll need this the most when you deal with me. In the process of discovering me, you'll will have the options to choose one of the following ACTIONS:</b></p>
<ul><b>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Pet (I Love this!)</li>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Feed (Only prefer this when I'm Hungry!)</li>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Hit (Hahahaha! Don't even dare to try it.)</li>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Water Splash (Seems fun right? Try it at your own risk.)</li>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Play (Don't prefer this when I'm feeling Sleepy!)</li>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">If you don't do any of this, my mood will automatically change over time! Wait and Watch bud!) </li>
</b></ul>

<p style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;"><b>Excited right? Wait a moment yet! Before you try any of the above actions, always remember that based on the way you treat me, I can react in one of the following manners:</b></p>
<ul><b>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Angry: One of the most unpreferrable states for the user. Don't worry I'm not mad enough to unnecessarily get angry. Remember folks, all depends on the way you treat me! (Tip: Studying the State Table on this page to know how to control once I'm in this state is all you need to survive!)</li>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Happy: I love being in this state! I'm sure even you'll love it. Again, studying the state table is the key to this step. Good Luck! </li>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Hungry: Please Understand! I'm a huge creature! I need a lot of food just like you do. So be sure to feed me regularly or face the consequences!</li>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Relaxed: There's no specific way in which I can define this state. It's kind of a NEUTRAL state in which you can try any action that you want.</li>
<li style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;">Sleepy: I don't like to play when I'm sleepy. Don't date to mess with me when I'm sleepy. I need rest too! However, study the state table to discover the thing that can make me happy when I'm sleepy!</li>
</b></ul>

<h2 style="color:Red;">State Table (The Key to Success!)</h2>
<p style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;"> <b>This table is the most important piece to understand my behavior. The FIRST ROW represents the "Stimulus". While the FIRST COLUMN represents "States".The inner cells represents the NEW STATE induced by the combination of EXISTING STATE and STIMULUS.</b></p>
<p style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;"> <b>***NOTE*** MORE Angry and MORE Hungry are the extreme stages! Once I reach there, you'll be DEAD! (You'll have to reload the page to start again!)</b></p>

<h2 style="color:Red;">Only For Programmers!</h2>
<p style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;"><b>As shown by the state table above, Mario can have FIVE STATES and FOUR STIMULI to change those states. However, in case of INACTIVITY for 7 seconds, the state is changed AUTOMATICALLY. Also, Mario being a Dragon, it has an ability to KILL THE PERSON in EXTREME CASES (MORE Angry or MORE Hungry). In that case, page freezes and Mario can only be accessed by RELOADING the page. </b></p>
<p style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;"><b>Further, moving towards the code, it is clearly divided into different functions. There are a different function for changing the states (ChangeStates()), Inactivity, Beginning the Timeout, Stopping the Timeout, Extreme cases (More Hungry or Angry), and all the Stimuli. Therefore, the data represented in the table mentioned above is executed using functions.</b></p>
<p style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;"><b>There are TWO global variables: state (counter for changing the image with change in states) and MyVar(which is used to call and terminate the timeout). As the user chooses any button for executing an action (stimuli), it calls the respective function, and image is changed according to the data represented in the state table. However, in case of an inactivity upto 7 seconds, the state changes automatically according to the data represented in the state table above. Math.random() method has been used to change few of the states in case of inactivity. As it returns a number between 0 and 1, state changes on the basis of the generated value compared to 0.5 (i.e. a particular state is obtained if a value is greater than 0.5 and another state is obtained if value is less than 0.5). This is done to maintain equal (50/50) randomness between the states. setTimeout() and clearTimeout() methods are use for that purpose. Remember, the code gets executed only when user loads the webpage and clicks any of the button. Until user clicks any of the button, inactivity isn't considered and Mario remains in the relaxed state.</b></p>
<p style="color:Yellow; font-size:20px;"><b>Another challenging and interesting fact about Mario lies in the "MORE Angry" and "MORE Hungry" states. The users have to be alert while dealing with Mario because once it reaches one of those states, it means that the user has reached extremes of carelessness and Mario will KILL THE USER. Hence, the user has to always be careful that Mario doesn't reach any of its EXTREME STATES. If it does, DEATH NOTICE and IMAGE appears on the screen and the webpage freezes. It has to be RELOADED to access MARIO again. </b></p>
